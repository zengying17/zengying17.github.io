## ate_pct (Stata & R)

Tools implementing estimation and inference for **average treatment effects in percentage points** under treatment-effect heterogeneity, developed in my paper  
**“Estimation and Inference on Average Treatment Effect in Percentage Points under Heterogeneity.”**

### Stata

- **Install (stable SSC release):**
```stata
ssc install ate_pct
````

* **Latest development version (GitHub):**
  [https://github.com/zengying17/ate_pct-stata](https://github.com/zengying17/ate_pct-stata)
  (includes example do-files and datasets)

* **Replication materials (Stata):**
  [https://github.com/zengying17/ate_pct-replication](https://github.com/zengying17/ate_pct-replication)
  (illustrates how to reproduce the empirical results in the paper using the `ate_pct` command)

### R

* **Latest version (GitHub):**
  [https://github.com/zengying17/ate_pct-r](https://github.com/zengying17/ate_pct-r)
  (includes example R scripts and datasets)

```

Notes:
- I changed your R repo link from `ate_pct-R` to `ate_pct-r` to match the repo you’ve used elsewhere (`zengying17/ate_pct-r`). If your actual repo name is different, swap the URL.
- If you want, I can add a short “Citation” block (one bibtex-style line) under the package description.
